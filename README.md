## Usage

Activate the plugin in **mkdocs.yml** (`scripts` is a required list of Python scripts to execute, always relative to **mkdocs.yml**):

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - gen-files:
      scripts:
        - gen_pages.py  # or any other name or path
```

Then create such a script **gen_pages.py** (this is relative to the root, *not* to the **docs** directory).

```python
import mkdocs_gen_files

with mkdocs_gen_files.open("foo.md", "w") as f:
    print("Hello, world!", file=f)
```

This added a programmatically generated page to our site. That is, the document doesn't actually appear in our source files, it only *virtually* becomes part of the site to be built by MkDocs.
